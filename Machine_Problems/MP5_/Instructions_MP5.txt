•	Student has a grade status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) this should be an enumerated type and a GPA (double).
•	Employee has a salary (long), and date hired (MyDate).
•	Faculty has office room # (int), tenure (bool) and office hours (vector of myDate objects - dates they are available in their office).

Each of these classes should have a Input() function to get its data from the user at the keyboard, and a Print() function to display its data. Each class should also have "The BIG Four" functions in them:
